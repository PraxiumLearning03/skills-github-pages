# Welcome to My First Jekyll Blog

Hello world! This is my first blog post using Jekyll. I'm excited to share some of what I've learned so far.

## What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator that lets you write content in Markdown and build a website with minimal code. It's perfect for personal blogs, portfolios, and more.

### Features of Jekyll
- **Easy Markdown**: Write posts in plain text files.
- **Automatic Permalinks**: URLs like `2025-06-11-welcome-to-my-first-jekyll-blog.md`.
- **Custom Layouts**: Choose from built-in templates or create your own.
- **Built-in Blogging Tools**: Automatic post sorting, pagination, and more.

### Including Assets
